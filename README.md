# Scripts

This repo is a collection of several different scripts. The main purpose on this repo is keep track of constantly 
evolving scripts. 

There are four subdirectories corresponding to an individual language that I use. The _Scripts_ isn't very useful to
others, although might be a good for some new comers to bioinformatics as I have a number of different python parsers
for different bioionformatics problems.

## BigDataScript

For those who don't know BigDataScript (BDS) is pipeline language can be used for any sorts of purposes where tasks need to
automated. The BDS focuses on bioinformatics, but like I said can be used anywhere. Here is a link to the site
