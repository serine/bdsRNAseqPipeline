# Scripts

This repo is a collection of several different scripts. The main purpose of this repo is to keep track of my constantly 
evolving scripts. 

There are four sub-directories corresponding to an individual language that I use. The _Scripts_ isn't very useful to
others, although might be a good for some new comers to bioinformatics as I have a number of different python parsers
for different bioionformatics problems.

## BigDataScript

For those who don't know BigDataScript (BDS) is pipeline language with the focus on bioinformatics, although can be
just as easily used for any sorts of purposes where tasks need to be automated. Here is a link to the official site
[BigDataScript](http://pcingola.github.io/BigDataScript/)

## BASH scripting

Please don't look into my sh directory. My BASH scripting skills are pretty poor.
